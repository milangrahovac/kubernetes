Interact with your cluster
If you already have kubectl installed (see documentation), 
you can now use it to access your shiny new cluster:

kubectl get po -A
Alternatively, minikube can download the appropriate version of kubectl 
and you should be able to use it like this:

minikube kubectl -- get po -A
You can also make your life easier by adding the following to your shell config: 
(for more details see: kubectl)

alias kubectl="minikube kubectl --"
Initially, some services such as the storage-provisioner, 
may not yet be in a Running state. This is a normal condition during cluster bring-up, 
and will resolve itself momentarily. For additional insight into your cluster state, 
minikube bundles the Kubernetes Dashboard, allowing you to get easily acclimated 
to your new environment:

minikube dashboard

Manage your cluster
Pause Kubernetes without impacting deployed applications:

minikube pause
Unpause a paused instance:

minikube unpause
Halt the cluster:

minikube stop
Change the default memory limit (requires a restart):

minikube config set memory 9001
Browse the catalog of easily installed Kubernetes services:

minikube addons list
Create a second cluster running an older Kubernetes release:

minikube start -p aged --kubernetes-version=v1.16.1
Delete all of the minikube clusters:

minikube delete --all
